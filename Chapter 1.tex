\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Abstract}
This report discuss the R implementation of the major statistical models used for pricing financial options. The models introduced are classified into two sections based on their approachs, either analytical or computational.

Analytical models generate exact estimation for option prices. Fundamental models such as Black-Scholes formula, Binomial tree, and Trinomial tree methods are discussed, following by an extension to multinomial tree solutions.

For more complex cases where analytical formula is infeasible to find, Monte Carlo based models provides computational path to find the options prices. Basic Monte Carlo model and its extensions, including Heston model, Jump Diffusion model, and Merton model are discussed.

\section{Literature Review}
In 1973, economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes introduced the Black-Scholes model, establishing the foundation for modern quantitative finance.
